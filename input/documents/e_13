Douglas Adams: Your tributes
The 60th birthday of the late writer Douglas Adams, creator of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, is to be marked with a special show.

Comedians, writers and scientists are coming together for the event at London's Hammersmith Apollo in March.

Clive Anderson, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin and Professor Brain Cox are set to participate in the one-off event.

Tickets for the show will go towards the Save the Rhino charity, which Adams supported.

According to the website, which has been set up especially for the event, there will be a "special premiere performance" of Douglas material.

As part of the line up, Anderson will talk to Terry Jones and Michael Palin about Douglas's comedy legacy and his influences, including Monty Python.

Stephen Fry and zoologist and wildlife photographer Mark Carwardine have recorded a special introduction about Douglas' passion for conservation.

Adams died in 2001 aged 49 following a heart attack.

More than 15 million copies of his The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series have been sold throughout the world.

He also wrote Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.
