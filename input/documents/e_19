Catherine Deneuve to receive Chaplin Award

Catherine Deneuve's film career spans seven decades
French actress Catherine Deneuve, best known for starring in Indochine and The Last Metro, will receive the prestigious Chaplin Award in the US.

The 68-year-old, who has worked with Roman Polanski and Francois Truffaut, will be honoured by the Film Society of Lincoln Center (FSLC) in April.

The award, now in its 39th year, was named in honour of Charlie Chaplin, who was the first recipient in 1972.

Previous recipients include Martin Scorsese, Tom Hanks and Robert Altman.

"It will be an honour to have Catherine Deneuve join our list of past honorees," said FSLC director Rose Kuo.

"It will be a joy to create an evening of style and grace befitting such an iconic screen presence."

Deneuve began her film career as a teenager, in the 1957 boarding school drama Les Collegiennes - known as The Twilight Girls in the US.

She gained wide acclaim for her role in Jacques Demy's 1964 musical Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg).

The star was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in the 1992 film, Indochine.

She played Elian Devries, an unmarried plantation owner who adopts a Vietnamese girl during the final days of French colonial rule in Indochina. The film also earned her a Cesar Award.

Her latest movie, Les Bien-aimes (The Beloved), was screened at last year's Cannes Film Festival.
