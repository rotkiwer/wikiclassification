Doncaster have signed the former Hull and Hull KR player Paul Cooke.

The former Challenge Cup winner agreed to join the Dons after fans and sponsors agreed to pay half of a monthly salary of Â£1,200.

The 30-year-old will combine playing for the club with a full-time job in their development department.

Chairman John Scarrow told BBC Radio Sheffield: "Alone we couldn't afford Paul so we set up a squad builder fund following a meeting with supporters."

"There's no doubt the contribution those fans have made goes way beyond our expectations."

Cooke, who will be on the same terms as the rest of the players, is now facing a race to be fit for the start of the season next month after being out of the game for 15 months.
