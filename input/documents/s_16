Rossi, who won his last title in 2009, said: "I want a new two-year contract with Ducati, maybe the last, and then I'll think about how to enjoy myself.

He has won nine championships, seven in the premier class, including five consecutive titles from 2001-05 and two more in 2008 and 2009, riding for Honda and Yamaha.
