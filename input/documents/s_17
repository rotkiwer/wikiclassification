Bolt won three gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing
Usain Bolt will make his first international appearance of the year at the Bislett Games in Oslo on 7 June.

The triple Olympic champion will run in the 100 metres at the event, which takes place six weeks before the 2012 Olympics gets underway.

Before that he plans to run at least three training races in Jamaica starting next month.

"My preparations have been good this fall [autumn], 2012 is going to be a great year!" he said in a statement.

"I am injury free, working hard and everything is going according to plan.

"There is only around six weeks to go to the London Olympics after this race and there is no doubt it will be surrounded by an enormous amount of interest."

Three gold medals at 2008 Beijing Olympics - 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay
Eyeing a repeat performance in London but wants to add a 4x400m gold
Also broke both the 100m and 200m world records in Beijing
Bolt, currently the 100m and 200m world record holder, will take part in races in Kingston at the Camperdown Classic on 11 February, the Gibson Relays on 25 Feb and the UWI Invitational on 17 March.

He is expected to run the 400m at the events to gauge his fitness, with his first sprint race likely to come at the Jamaica International Invitational in Kingston on 5 May.

The 25-year-old broke his first world record in 2004 when he beat the previous World Junior 200m record with a time of 19.93 seconds.

He then broke both the 100m and 200m world records at the 2008 Beijing Olympics running the 100m in just 9.69secs and the 200m in 19.30secs.

He bettered both of those times a year later at the World Championships in Berlin. The 100m record now stands at 9.58secs, while the 200m record is 19.19secs.

The Jamaican has already declared that he wants to try and become a "legend" at London 2012 by winning four gold medals.
