The rivalry between Oscar Pistorius and Jerome Singleton is a friendly one
Jerome Singleton says that his 100m showdown with Oscar Pistorius will be a highlight of the London Paralympics.

The American sprinter beat the South African double amputee at last year's World Championships in New Zealand.

He is now hoping to do the same again in the Paralympic final on 6 September.


"It's going to be a phenomenal race. The quality of amputee sprinting at the moment means this race is going to be the best ever," Singleton told BBC Radio 5 live.

"You will see Oscar and I racing head-to-head and we will both be trying to make it the best show possible."

Singleton, 25, had his right leg amputated below the knee when he was aged 18 months as a result of a birth defect and after playing basketball and American Football as well as competing in hurdles, he moved to Paralympic sport in 2006.

He finished second to Pistorius in the 100m at the Beijing Paralympics but at that time was combining training with studying maths, applied physics and industrial engineering at the University of Michigan.

Following his dramatic photo-finish victory in New Zealand and now as a full-time athlete, he is targetting another big victory.

"The goal is to go out there and try my best and reach my potential this year," he added. "I look at Oscar like a brother. He's like a best friend but I want to beat him when it comes to competition."
