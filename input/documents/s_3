Robby Gordon is facing disqualification from this year's Dakar Rally
Stewards want to throw the American out of the race over his Hummer's engine

(CNN) -- American Robby Gordon faces disqualification from the Dakar Rally after stewards recommended his removal from the race because his Hummer's engine does not conform to regulations.
The 43-year-old appeared the main challenger to car leader Stephane Peterhansel after winning both Monday's and Tuesday's stages, to close to withing five minutes.
However, Gordon's fate in the race now rests with motorsport's governing body, the FIA, after he lodged an appeal over the stewards' decision.
The stewards believe that Gordon's modifying of the ventilation system, linked to his engine, improves its performance level -- a claim he denies.
That appeal allowed Gordon to continue racing in the 377km 10th stage from Iquique to Arica in Chile, although his hopes took a further knock as he subsequently lost 15 minutes to stage winner Nani Roma of Spain.
Roma's victory means he leapfrogs Gordon into second-place overall behind fellow-Mini driver Peterhansel, with four stages left.
Peterhansel is bidding for a remarkable 10th win in the race and a fourth in the car section.
Meanwhile, just 16 seconds now separate KTM riders Cyril Despres and Marc Coma in the motorcycle section after Wednesday's stage, which was won by Joan Barreda Bort.
Coma finished second to his fellow-Spaniard on the day, while Despres came home fourth.
Both riders have won the race three times, alternating victory between each other over the last six seasons.
