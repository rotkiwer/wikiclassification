She's got an awfully big nursery to break in!

The Daily News reports that Beyonce, 30, and Jay-Z, 42, dodged photographers by exiting via the uptown NYC hospital's side gate around 1:30 a.m.; two SUVs with tinted windows blocked traffic on East 76th street to allow the passage of a van. (No word yet on which vehicle held the famous family, or whether the procession was a decoy for an alternate departure.)

Fans worldwide are celebrating the birth of the superstar couple's very first child -- who even made her vocal debut, crying in Jay-Z's new song "Glory," -- but other new parents at Lenox Hill reportedly complained of the turmoil Blue Ivy's birth caused.
