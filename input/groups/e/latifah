"You know you should get kids," Dolly said.
The actress said she would even draw some inspiration from her current "Joyful" character, Vi, who is a no-nonsense single mother of two teens.
"I would be like Vi Rose in a lot of ways. My kids would be raised properly. They would be raised with values and morals and God, but I don't think I would be like Vi Rose in the other ways," she explained. "I would probably allow them to be themselves a little more and explore their gifts and their talents. I'd try to be more like my mom."

Access spoke with the actress at the movie's premiere on Monday night in Los Angeles, where she raved about working alongside her country music legend co-star.
"She's funny as hell. She is funny and quick-witted. She's a little bit rambunctious. But ultimately, she's an icon. She works harder than anyone I know," Queen said of Dolly. "She is dedicated, she loves music and she loves her family and her friends. She treats everyone around her as family. That means a lot."
