Castleford winger Kirk Dixon is fit to kick off the new season after recovering from shoulder surgery.

Cas's 2011 top scorer had to undergo shoulder reconstruction after a season-ending injury in the Challenge Cup semi-final defeat by Leeds last August.

But he has reported back for pre-season training and is now scheduled to turn out in a friendly against neighbours Huddersfield on Friday night.

Jake Emmitt is also expected to figure after recovering from a knee injury.

Last season's Man of Steel Rangi Chase, now an England international, also plays, as does Josh Griffin, Cas's close-season signing from neighbours Wakefield.

Griffin scored a try in Tigers' Boxing Day derby with Bradford, as did young centre Josh Atkinson, who crossed twice, and on-loan Warrington centre Ryan Shaw will also feature.

But it is the return to full fitness of Dixon, who ran in seven Super League tries last term, as well as kicking 84 goals, which will be of most comfort to new Cas coach Ian Millward as he prepares for his first game in charge at Salford on Saturday, 4 February at 1800 GMT.
